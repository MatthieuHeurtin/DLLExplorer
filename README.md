# DLLExplorer

This project is just the beginning. During my internship (3 years ago), the app I was developing was supposed to load existing dlls. Some DLL were old an not 
supported. So I did a tool that just read DLLs.

I started this project on my own and i finished it at work. What you can see is just an alpha version.

How does it work?

1/ select a folder with dll in it.
2/ click on Parse
3/ Click on see details to see the details about the dll.
